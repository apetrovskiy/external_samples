Testing with previous versions of ReSharper can be tricky, but it can be done.

Here's a quick how to for Visual Studio 2010. You will need the Visual Studio 2010 SDK installed.

* ReSharper 5.1

Let's start with 5.1 (when doing this, it's best to install from the oldest version up).

1. Make sure all versions of ReSharper are uninstalled
2. Install ReSharper 5.1
3. Create a new experimental hive (I called it rs51) using the CreateExpInstance.exe from the VS-SDK
   (located in %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin)
   CreateExpInstance /Create /VSInstance=10.0 /RootSuffix=rs51
4. Run Visual Studio using this experimental hive: devenv.exe /RootSuffix rs51
   (/log is also a handy command line switch. See ActivityLog.xml in %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0rs51)
5. ReSharper 5.1 should run just fine. However, it's set up as a per-machine extension, and will disappear
   when you upgrade ReSharper
6. Edit %ProgramFiles(x86)%\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.1\Bin\extension.vsixmanifest
   Change the InstalledByMsi and SystemComponent elements from true to false
   (as you're in Program Files, you'll need to start the edit session as an administrator, or you won't be able to save)
7. Move the two shortcut files extension.vsixmanifest.lnk and ReSharperRegistry.vs10.0.PkgDef.lnk from
   %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.1
   to the %AppData%\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0rs51\Extensions\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.1\ folder
   (you might need to create some folders). So, the Visual Studio program files folder should be empty,
   and the folder in your profile should have 2 shortcuts in
8. Edit the registry for HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0rs51\ExtensionManager\EnabledExtensions
   Add a string value with a name of "JetBrains.ReSharper,5.1" and set the value to the bin folder of the ReSharper install:
   (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.1\Bin\")
9. IMPORTANT: Make a copy of the %ProgramFiles(x86)% folder at this point. The ReSharper installers DO NOT honour
   the "leave installed, I will remove" checkbox, and ALWAYS removes previous versions. If you do lose an install,
   copying the copy made in this step back to the original name will allow it to continue working

Starting Visual Studio with /RootSuffix rs51 should now run ReSharper 5.1 in an experimental hive, and from a known folder


* ReSharper 6.0

1. Install ReSharper 6.0
   If you have 5.1 installed, and you click on Advanced, you will be prompted about what to do with conflicting versions.
   You should select "Do not uninstall". The installer appears to have a bug - files are still removed from the old
   directory, regardless of which option you select. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A COPY FIRST! And then simply copy it back
   again after installing 6.0
2. Ensure ReSharper 6.0 is installed correctly, and is not e.g. trying to use the previous version when loading 
3. Create a new experimental hive (I called it rs60) using the CreateExpInstance.exe from the VS-SDK
   (located in %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin)
   CreateExpInstance /Create /VSInstance=10.0 /RootSuffix=rs60
4. Run Visual Studio using this experimental hive, enabling ReSharper's "internal" (developer/debugging) menus:
   devenv.exe /RootSuffix rs60 /ReSharper.Internal
   This has to be run as Administrator so that ReSharper can delete the shortcuts in the per-machine folder
5. ReSharper recognises that you're running in an experimental hive and offers to set everything up for you.
   You should answer "Yes, make the extension run in this hive only" (this will fail if you are not running
   as Administrator!)
   This does automatically the steps that were done manually for 5.1 above. (edits the extension.vsixmanifest
   and places the shortcuts in the local experimental hive folder)

You should now be able to run devenv.exe /RootSuffix rs51 and devenv.exe /RootSuffix rs60 and everything can be
kept separate.

Again, keep a copy of the %ProgramFiles%\JetBrains\ReSharper\v6.0 so that the installer bug doesn't ruin your day

And if you accidentally run the rs51 hive before completing these steps, the registry value in EnabledExtensions
has probably been deleted - see step 8 above.


* ReSharper 6.1 (EAP)

Since this is currently in EAP and updating (mostly) nightly, I use this as my main install, and just install
daily. The 5.1 and 6.0 experimental hives are safe, but I do need to copy the 6.0 files back (oddly, the 5.1
files seem ok). However, if you try and run the experimental hives, 6.1 also tries to load, so you must move
6.1 to a per-user extension point. This is the same as what happens above, except it happens in the main hive,
not the experimental hive (it moves the extension.vsixmanifest file from out of Program Files and into a
ReSharper version specific local folder, storing the path to this folder in the registry belonging to the hive.

1. Run as internal (as administrator!) - devenv.exe /ReSharper.Internal
2. ReSharper will prompt to move to a per-user install. Select Yes. Everything should be fine.



Visual Studio 2008

ReSharper 4.5 allowed you to install it into an Visual 2008 experimental hive, using an msbuild task that is
still shipped in 6.1. I haven't tried it.
