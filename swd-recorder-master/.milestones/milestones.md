# On hold  
[ ] @yuriw: “finding differences between different versions.  Consider this scenario: a test developer used SWD to build Object Pages, everything worked fine and then in a new version nothing works anymore, because some locators/HTML changed.”  
@dzhariy: “Probably it would be reasonable to add such verification, but I cannot implement that now in convenient way”  
  
[ ] @yuriw “compare a previous Object Pages vs current and highlight quickly differences, would you like it?”  
@dzhariy: “Probably, it is hard to find the actual list of elements. It is hard to define the actual logical PageObject borders, but this idea is worth for  further consideration”  
 
[ ] C# PageObject loading/source code integration  
[ ] Implement Save Capabilities settings
