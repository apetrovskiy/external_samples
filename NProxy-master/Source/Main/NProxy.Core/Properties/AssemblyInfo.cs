// The Common Language Specification (CLS) defines naming restrictions,

// explicitly indicate CLS compliance with CLSCompliantAttribute. If the 
// attribute is not present on an assembly, the assembly is not compliant.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:

//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision

// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers
