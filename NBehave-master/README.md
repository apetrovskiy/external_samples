NBehave
=======
NBehave is a framework for Behaviour-Driven Development

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.

It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a design philosophy.
