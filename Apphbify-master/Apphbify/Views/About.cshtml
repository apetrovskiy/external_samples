    <h1>About AppHarbify</h1>
</div>
<p>
    AppHarbify aims to be a simple platform that helps with both the deployment of software to
    <a href="http://www.appharbor.com" rel="external">AppHarbor</a>
    and the maintenance of software already deployed.
</p>
<p>
    The goal is to promote open source and .NET development. I want every piece of .NET open source to be written for the &#145;cloud&#146; and deployable by AppHarbify.
</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>
    AppHarbify automates the steps involved in getting software running on AppHarbor. These typically include
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creation of a site
    </li>
    <li>
        Application configuration
    </li>
    <li>
        Add-on configuration
    </li>
    <li>
        Code deployment
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>
    AppHarbify offers simple to install tools for the maintenance of any site you host on AppHarbor, whether it was deployed with AppHarbify or not.
